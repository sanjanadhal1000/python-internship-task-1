Week 2 — Data Structures and Functions

Concepts Learned

During Week 2, I learned about Python’s core data structures and how they help organize and process data efficiently.

* Lists: storing multiple values, indexing, slicing, and list methods.
* Tuples: immutable sequences for fixed data.
* Dictionaries: key-value pairs for mapping and fast lookups.
* Sets: storing unique elements and performing mathematical set operations.
* Functions: defining reusable blocks of code using `def`.
* Lambda Functions: small anonymous functions for short operations.
* Recursion: a function calling itself to solve repetitive tasks.
* List Comprehension: compact syntax for creating lists from loops and conditions.

Hands-On Tasks

* Practiced creating and manipulating lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
* Wrote functions to perform tasks like finding the sum of squares and filtering data.
* Explored lambda expressions and recursive functions.

---

Client Project

Developed a data cleaning script that:

* Removes duplicate values from a dataset.
* Filters out invalid or missing data.
* Prints the cleaned data and its summary.

Outcome

Gained confidence in writing modular, efficient Python code using functions and data structures. 
This week’s practice helped me understand how to clean and organize raw data for further analysis.
