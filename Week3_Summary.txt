Week 3 — NumPy and Pandas for Data Manipulation

Concepts Learned

In Week 3, I explored NumPy and Pandas, two powerful libraries used for data analysis and manipulation in Python.

* NumPy:

  * Learned about arrays, array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, and broadcasting.
  * Performed mathematical operations on arrays and used built-in functions like `np.mean()`, `np.sum()`, `np.sqrt()`, etc.
  * Understood how NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.

* Pandas:

  * Learned about Series and DataFrames for handling tabular data.
  * Practiced indexing, filtering, and grouping data.
  * Used functions like `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.groupby()`, and `.fillna()` for exploration and cleaning.
  * Understood how to read/write data from CSV files using `pd.read_csv()` and `to_csv()`.

Hands-On Tasks

* Created and manipulated NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
* Cleaned data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
* Aggregated and summarized datasets using grouping and mean calculations.

Client Project

Built a data cleaning and aggregation script that:

* Reads a dataset using Pandas.
* Removes missing values and duplicates.
* Calculates average and total values for selected columns.
* Saves the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.

Outcome

I learned how to preprocess, clean, and analyze datasets efficiently using NumPy and Pandas. These skills are foundational for any data analysis or machine learning workflow.
