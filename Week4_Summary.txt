Week 4 — Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Concepts Learned

In Week 4, I learned how to visually explore and communicate insights from data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, two essential Python libraries for data visualization.

* Matplotlib:

  * Learned how to create line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms using 
  `plt.plot()`, `plt.bar()`, `plt.scatter()`, and `plt.hist()`.
  * Added titles, axis labels, legends, and customized colors and styles for better readability.
  * Understood how to visualize multiple plots using subplots.

* Seaborn:

  * Created advanced and more visually appealing plots such as heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots.
  * Learned to visualize relationships between features using `sns.scatterplot()`, `sns.barplot()`, and `sns.heatmap()`.
  * Explored datasets using Seaborn’s built-in sample data (like `tips` and `iris`).

Hands-On Tasks

* Generated multiple types of plots (bar, scatter, histogram) using Matplotlib.
* Used Seaborn to create pairplots and heatmaps for deeper data relationships.
* Customized plot themes and palettes to improve clarity and aesthetics.

Client Project

Created a Data Visualization Dashboard that:

* Reads a CSV dataset using Pandas.
* Displays distributions of key variables using histograms.
* Shows correlations using Seaborn heatmaps.
* Plots relationships between numerical features using scatter plots and pairplots.

Outcome

By the end of Week 4, I was able to effectively visualize data trends, relationships, and patterns 
using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also learned to interpret visual results to derive meaningful insights — 
an essential step before machine learning or reporting.
